Installation (please read carefully)

Extract the contents of the .rar file and place each element as follows:

- "Black Market Bazaar" folder ---> My Documents/My Games/LegendaryHeroes/Mods

- "Black Market Bazaar Icons" folder ---> My Documents/My Games/LegendaryHeroes/Mods/Gfx

- "BMB.str" file ---> My Documents/My Games/LegendaryHeroes/Mods/Data

Don't forget to "enable mods" and start a new game.

To uninstall, simply delete the two folders and the "BMB.str" file.

ALSO: If you do not have the DLC05 (Leader Pack DLC) installed, then you will need to delete the "BMB_Items_DLC05.xml" file found in the "Black Market Bazaar" folder. No biggie if you don't but be warned that the 4 "Treasure Finder" items won't have any effects in your games.

The full list of items with their stats can be found in the image section of the Nexus page. The color codes of this psychedelic nightmare are as follow: gray for common, yellow for uncommon and orange for rare.


Special Thanks:
- to Stardock for this wonderful addictive game.
- to Primal_Savage for his his encyclopedic modding knowledge, encouragements, suggestions, corrections and for being an all around nice guy. Check out his amazing XtraDeconstruct mod for a host of novel features and to find out just how much FE:LH can be pushed beyond its limits.
- to all the players who've dropped a line and sent feedback my way, it's always been appreciated. To all the "endorsers" on Nexus, you have my most sincere gratitude! :)

Compatibility:
Black Market Bazaar should be compatible with most mods. You will have to use the "mods compatible version" however if you wish to use it along with mods which add new unit models types and/or unitstats (see below).

Optional BMB version:
- Black Market Bazaar compatible with Additional Faction Traits and Races, Blood and Mana, Between Life & Death, Children of Storm, Demons & Wizards, Henchwomen, Path of the Paladin & XtraDeconstruct. Install this version if you wish to use BMB with these mods.
