# Black Market Bazaar - Continued

A mod project for the video game **Elemental: Reforged**.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the script runner)
- The game installed (the Mods folder is the deployment target)
- Supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Clone and install

```
git clone <repo-url>
cd felh-black-market-bazaar
npm install
```

---

## Local Build Configuration

This project uses a **local build config** file that is machine-specific and never committed to version control.

### Setup (first time)

1. Copy the example file to create your local config:

   ```
   cp .build.config.example.json build.config.json
   ```

2. Open `build.config.json` and set `deployPath` to the Mods folder on your machine:

   **Windows:**

   ```json
   { "deployPath": "C:\\Users\\alice\\Documents\\My Games\\ElementalReforged\\Mods" }
   ```

   **macOS:**

   ```json
   { "deployPath": "/Users/alice/Library/Application Support/ElementalReforged/Mods" }
   ```

   **Linux:**

   ```json
   { "deployPath": "/home/alice/.local/share/ElementalReforged/Mods" }
   ```

> `build.config.json` is listed in `.gitignore` -- your local path will never be committed.
>
> `.build.config.example.json` is the committed template; do not edit it with real paths.

## Build Command

Deploys `Mods/197542/` to the game's Mods folder in one step.

### Run directly

```
npm run build
```

Or equivalently:

```
node scripts/build.mjs
```

What it does:

1. Reads `build.config.json` and validates `deployPath`.
2. Confirms `Mods/197542/` exists in the project.
3. Deletes `<deployPath>/197542/` if it already exists (clean slate).
4. Copies `Mods/197542/` to `<deployPath>/197542/`.
5. Prints a summary: `Build complete. N file(s) deployed to: <path>`.

The operation is idempotent — running it again produces the same result.

### Error cases

| Condition | Message | Exit code |
|---|---|---|
| `build.config.json` missing | `build.config.json not found. Copy .build.config.example.json ...` | 1 |
| `deployPath` absent or empty | `build.config.json is missing a valid deployPath ...` | 1 |
| `deployPath` does not exist | `deployPath does not exist or is not accessible: <path>` | 1 |
| `deployPath` is not a directory | `deployPath is not a directory: <path>` | 1 |
| Source folder `Mods/197542/` missing | `Source folder not found: <path>` | 1 |

### Use from another script

```js
import { build } from './scripts/build.mjs';
await build();
```

The exported `build()` function is async and uses `process.exit(1)` on failure,
making it safe to call directly from menu handlers without an extra child process.

## Script Runner

```
npm run menu
```

Launches an interactive terminal menu with shortcut keys for common tasks.
Must be run in an interactive terminal (TTY). Press **q** or **Ctrl+C** to quit.

### Available menu items

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `a` | Generate context documentation (`ctx generate`) |
| `b` | Build mod (deploy to game folder) |
| `c` | Generate item reference (`docs/references/`) |
| `q` | Quit |

Keys are assigned alphabetically in declaration order. Adding a new item appends the next letter automatically. The menu supports up to 26 items (a–z).
